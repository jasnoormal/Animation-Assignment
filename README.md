# Animation-Assignment

This code is an example of an animation of a ball moving back and forth on our screen. There are many conditional statements in this code that allow the user to interact with the code as well. Some examples are if the user presses their mouse, then the ball will go a certain direction, and if the user presses their keys, the ball will go a certain direction. There are instructions on the screen for the user to read and follow while they are interacting witht he code.
